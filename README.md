MacaroniCore
============

MacaroniCore is a game engine, or something like that.

It basically just does a lot of heavy lifting to let me focus on things other than writing hundreds of lines of boilerplate code to set up shaders, copy-pasting common classes, half-assing abstraction for only the things I use for the current project and banging my head against my desk over the stupid things that happen when trying to run what I make on Windows.

FAQ
===
* Why make your own engine when there are so many already?
    1. Because it's fun.
    1. I want to make things, not spend hours learning how others do them.
* Why should I use your engine?
    * You probably shouldn't, but I'm not stopping you if you want to.
* Where's the documentation?
    * There's a Doxygen file called "doxyfile" in the root of the repo. Install [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org) and use that file (`doxygen doxyfile` in a terminal) to make a "doc" folder and fill it with delicious autogenerated documentation.
